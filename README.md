# People Analytics Dashboard
It is a small project about people analytics analysis. 
I created a script in python using pandas and numpy for merged two randons datasets about managers in general, and tableau software for create a dashboard for visualization. 
The main goal was answered: What are the characteristics of a good manager?

I used the correlation matrix to identify two positive variables. So I found the following answer:
The manager who is a top performer has the characteristics
- High hour flag
- The average score of 292
- The average of 24 customers in your account
- The average of 25 in your group
- And the average of 4 years of working time

The visualization is avaiable on:

Managerial overview - https://public.tableau.com/views/PeopleAnalytics-managerialdashboard/Managerialoverview?:language=pt-BR&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
Here I present the big numbers, without any calculations, with all the characteristics of the data sets. With employee distribution map and a filter to view any data manager.

This dashboard shows about the main average variables of managers.
